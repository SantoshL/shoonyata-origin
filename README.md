# Shoonyata Origin

An interactive, web-based visual metaphor for the Shoonyata Framework, exploring concepts of observer-dependent meaning, boundaries, and the uncharacterizable origin (Śūnyatā).

## Concept

The experience guides the user through a narrative sequence:

1.  **Nothing:** A blank page with a central point of origin.
2.  **No-thing:** The user is prompted to be curious, activating their mouse.
3.  **Meaning-Making:** The user's movement (the "Observer's" curiosity) creates a trace—a line representing the path of their attention. The distance from the origin is displayed as **ΔCMH**, a measure of semantic drift.
4.  **Boundary Formation:** Once enough "meaning" has been generated (a sufficient path length), the line collapses into a complex, morphing polyhedron. This represents the **Recursive Fractal Boundary (RFB)**—a stable, multi-faceted structure that defines the observer's constructed reality.
5.  **Exploration:** The user can then use orbital controls to inspect this dynamic, ever-changing boundary from all angles, representing the observer's ability to reflect on their own meaning-space.

The core philosophical idea, **∂(∂(x)) = 0**, is displayed at the bottom, suggesting that this complex boundary ultimately arises from a ground of boundless potential.

## Tech Stack

-   HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-   Three.js for 3D rendering and animation
-   Deployed on Vercel

## Local Development

1.  Ensure you have a local web server to handle ES Modules correctly. The "Live Server" extension for VSCode is a great option.
2.  Right-click `index.html` and choose "Open with Live Server".

## Deployment

This project is connected to a GitHub repository. Any push to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a new deployment on Vercel.
